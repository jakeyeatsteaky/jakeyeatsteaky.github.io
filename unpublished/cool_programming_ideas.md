# ways to learn programming languagess

One cool thing would be to create the javascript map in c++
it allows any typed pair association so it could be like:
"string" : int,
object : "string"
etc

Not sure how you could do it yet but I think it would be fun to make one

The path to really learning C++ I think will come from this idea of:
Read a chapter
learn about it and write code 
write about it
repeat

Run with it
