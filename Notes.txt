HTML Semantic Markup
{
    i.e. meaningful markup, or markup thats meaningful to the content of that document
    - kind of like having good naming convention or type names 
    - e.g. <main>, <section> <header> <nav> <footer> <summary> <details>
    - good for giving meaning to markup, also for screen readers
}

HTML 
{
    Block vs. Inline Elements:
        - Block level takes its own line like a <p></p>
        - Inline Elements share the space, like a <a> or <img>

    <div>
        - a block level generic container to group elements together
        - useful for using css on al the same stuff. css applied to the same group
            determined by the class in the div
            <div class=something></div>
            Then the css can refer to .something{}
        
    <span>
        - an inline generic container
        - used to wrap around specific things in line to change them with css
        - like some words in a sentence which are changed a little bit

    <hr>
        - no closing tab
        - just a horizontal line across the page
        - it can be styled
    
    <br> 
        - break, basically a carriage return

    <sup> , <sub>
        - superscript and subscript (does have closing tags)
    
    Entity Codes:
        - All start with & and end with ;
        - some symbols coorespond to some text inside those
