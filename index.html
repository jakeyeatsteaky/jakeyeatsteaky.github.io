            This is where I will keep track and show off some of my projects.
            The things I like to work on are:
            <ul>
                <li>Graphics Programming</li>
                <li>Game Development</li>
                <li>Weightlifting Things</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Hopefully this will be a cool way to show the things I am interested in, and my skills as a developer.
